👋 Hi, I’m @Marielysech. I'm a career shifter and learning passionate, getting out of my comfort zone is a priority to push myself, to evolve and learning is its cornerstone. 

👩‍💻 Becoming a Full Stack developer is a way to quench my curiosity as it requires me to learn and adapt to fast-moving technologies constantly. 

⛰️ I'm still at the beginning of this new Web Development journey and we'll be happy to exchange to learn more, extend my views and take part in new projects within a team!

🔎  Passionate about understanding users, I capitalize on 4+ years as a market researcher to develop user-centric app with UX as a priority.

☕ Reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-lyse-charriere/) to exchange idea, work together or just take a coffee!
